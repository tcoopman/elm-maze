# Elm Maze

A maze implementation in Elm.
Let's see if we can improve this at Socrates Be.

You must have at least elm 0.17 installed. The easiest way is probably with `npm install -g elm`.
Check out http://elm-lang.org/install for more info.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

go to `http://localhost:8080`
